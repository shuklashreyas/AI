    "As we are steadily advancing towards Reinforcement Learning in class, it's time to get our hands dirty with another cool Python package. Gymnasium, originally developed by OpenAI is a useful tool that is commonly used for solving RL-related challenges. With Gymnasium, users can easily design, implement, and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms by leveraging predefined environments such as classic control tasks, Atari 2600 games, and more. Furthermore, Gymnasium provides an easy API to implement your own environments!"

The printed output can be a bit tricky to read - the first list in the observation space above contains minimum values for the set of quantities that are modeled, and the second list contains the maxima. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular problem (Mountain Car), the values at index 0 within both lists refer to the minimum and maximum value of the car's position along the x-axis, i.e. the car will always be between x=-1.2 and x=0.6. The values at index 1 represent the range of the velocity, i.e. the car's speed will be between -0.07 and 0.07. Both these values are allowed to vary continuously with the precision of the float32 dtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete, on the other hand, signifies that there are a finite number of options to choose from. In this case, Discrete(3) represents the fact that the agent has three choices: 0: accelerate left, 1: don't accelerate, and 2: accelerate right.
